"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py           compare; exit 1 on any drift
    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py --write   regenerate demo/shaders.js

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means a copy has drifted.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/shaders.js` holds the GLSL pieces of `source/Shaders.cpp` (kQuadVertex,
the kCommon library, and the surface, occlusion and project fragments) plus
kVersion. That is two copies of the same text, and two copies drift --
quietly, because a wall lit by a *plausible* shader looks exactly like one lit
by the right one. The whole claim of the page is that it runs the plugin's own
shaders, so the claim needs something enforcing it. `twtest` drives the real
plugin class and has never heard of this page, and `tools/glslc.sh` compiles
the C++ copies and never looks at the JS one.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

Pulls each piece out of `source/Shaders.cpp` and the matching backtick literal
out of `demo/shaders.js`, and compares them exactly -- no whitespace
normalisation, no comment stripping: a comment updated on one side only is
exactly the drift worth catching. `kVersion`, a plain string, is compared too.

A piece may be several adjacent raw strings (MSVC refuses one literal over
about 16 KB, C2026); this joins them as the compiler does, with nothing
between. None of Throw's pieces needs that today.

It fails when Shaders.cpp grows a piece this script does not list (a new pass
the page would silently lack), and it checks the JOIN as well as the pieces:
`Assemble()` in Shaders.cpp is kVersion + kCommon + the pass's fragment;
InitGL in Throw.cpp builds the vertex stage as kVersion + kQuadVertex and each
fragment stage with Assemble(). plugin.js must assemble them the same way. A
change to either side's assembly fails here and needs a reader.

And it fails when a fragment declares a uniform that plugin.js never names: a
uniform the page does not set sits at 0, which is a control that is quietly
dead on the page and live in the plugin.

The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation: a backtick cannot
appear raw inside a template literal, so --write escapes one as \\`.
kProjectFragment has one, in a comment. This undoes that escape and REJECTS
any other backslash or any `${` on the JS side; there are none in the C++
bodies, so either could only be somebody hiding a difference.

`--write` produces shaders.js from the C++ by exactly that escape, so the copy
is spliced by this script and never typed.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

Nothing here checks the PORTED half: Controls.cpp (the mappings and the
table), Room.cpp (the room, the relief, the paper's generations, the metals),
HeightFile's reading of a file and the CPU half of Throw.cpp's ProcessOpenGL
and buildSurface (the surface key, every uniform) in demo/plugin.js are a hand
translation. demo/tools/crosscheck/ renders twtest and the page over the same
card and compares the pictures; it needs Chrome and a GPU, so it is run by
hand, not by verify.sh. When you change one of those, change the port too.
